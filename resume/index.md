Resume
======

I am Richard Browning, a Software Engineer from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I consider myself to be a very hardworking, committed individual, with many key skills that are suited to both team and solo projects.  I work well within a team or as a leader and continually met required deadlines for any projects. These team situations have given me excellent communication skills that include being able to put forward my own ideas but listen to others to resolve tough situations.


### Experience ###

##### HP Autonomy, Software Designer

*07/2012 - current*

I began working on the web interface for a new Legacy Data Analysis product, written using **ASP.net MVC** and **Web API** on the server, **Typescript**, **Knockout.JS** and **D3.js** on the client. In this project I was responsible for implementing large parts of the UI as well as getting to work on features that spanned the entire stack of the product.

Off the back of working of this UI work I was chosen to lead a new project in HP Software which would be responsible for consolidating and implementing UI Design patterns to be used across multiple teams. We use **LESS** for styling and have created an **Angular** module distributed via a **Bower** package, filled with directives and other modules that teams can consume. This project is a fantastic experience, I get to collaborate with a range of developers and build a community around this project bringing many teams together and giving them a space to communicate.

As well as working on this project I have also been asked to lead another UI team that is too create a UI on top of a new cloud API that is being created in our office. This gives me the opportunity to dog food the work from my other project and push feedback straight into it. This UI is written in **Tyescript**, **Angular** and **LESS** using **Grunt** to build it.

##### First Derivatives, Software Engineer

*08/2011 - 07/2012*

I worked on the database for their flagship product Delta Control, which is developed solely using **Q**, a KX language used for handling large amounts of time sequence data.

##### Microsoft, Intern SDE 

*06/2009 – 06/2010*

I was part of a dynamic team that helped develop a localization website that received an honourable mention in 2010 Engineering Excellence awards inside Microsoft.  We used the **ASP.NET** framework to create our web application as well as console and toolbar components.  We had a SQL Server for the back end, which we all developed stored procedures for.  Client side we used **AJAX**, **jQuery** and **Telerik** library to create our interface for the web application.

##### Infosys Ltd, Intern

*06/2011 – 08/2011*

I worked on a research project for performance testing team in Pune India. I was responsible for gathering useful information and creating a wiki that the team could use in the future.

##### Queen’s University Belfast, Java Demonstrator

*09/2010- 06/2011*

I was responsible for mentoring a group of first year students through their **Java** practicals. This experience helped me improve my knowledge transfer skills which have proven to be extremely useful when working in teams.

### Education ###

+ *09/2011* - Queen’s University Belfast  - **First Class BEng Computer Science**
+ *08/2007* - A levels - **Maths, A; Technology, A; Physics, A;**

### Technical Skills ###

I consider myself a web developer and have developed my technical skills accordingly. I love Javascript, seems almost anything can be written in it, I have experience in different libraries such as **Knockout.JS**, **Angular** and **jQuery** but am always willing to try something new. I have experience with the **LESS** CSS preprocessor as well as **Grunt** for building projects. I have also used **Typescript** extensively to provide type safety through out larger applications. I always keep up to date with the latest web technologies and try to integrate them into projects were applicable. I try to use **HTML5** and **CSS3**  as much as possible.

I have lots of experience developing **C#** applications ranging from command line interfaces, games to cloud hosted websites in the **Azure** cloud. Most projects I have been a part of have used **SQL Server** for data storage.

Source control has always been used on project I have worked on so I have experience in using **Git**, **Perforce**, **Subversion** and **Source Depot**.

At HP Autonomy I was lucky enough to receive **Agile** training and I am currently **Scrum Master** on a project. I also try to write **DRY** code and always follow **YAGNI** which I feel is critical as over engineering is a huge issue on most projects.

### Outside Work ###

I have recently taken up mountain biking in my spare time and I am really enjoying getting to explore the great trails that have been created through out Northern Ireland recently. I am also a keen Ulster Rugby fan, having played in school and Antrim Rugby Club, and regularly attend Ulster matches at the Kingspan Stadium, it's a great way to spend a Friday night!
