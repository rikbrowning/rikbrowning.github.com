Today I browsed [Sans Bullshit Sans](http://www.sansbullshitsans.com) and noticed (as most sites have these days) a nice large title image taking up most of the screen. Me being a web developer I like seeing how other developers solve problems so I decided to take a look at how the made the image always took up 100% height in the viewport. Then I saw it:

{% highlight css %}
 height:100vh;
{% endhighlight %}

##100vh

I hadn't came across this before, so I immediately googled it (as you do). ``vh`` = viewport height, the preceding number is the percentage of the viewport height to take up, so ``100vh`` means that it always takes up 100% of the viewport height even when it changes. What is even better than this is that even IE9 supports it and ``vw`` (viewport width) is also available.
